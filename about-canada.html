                CANADA CURRENCY
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Canadian dollar, shortened as CAD or C$, is the country's currency. It is currently valued
                significantly less than the US dollar, often about 70-80 US cents. The CAD is divided into the following
                denominations:
                <ul>
                    <li>$1 (coin)</li>
                    <li>$2 (coin)</li>
                    <li>$5 (coin)</li>
                    <li>$10 (coin)</li>
                    <li>$20 (coin)</li>
                    <li>$50 (coin)</li>
                    <li>$100 (coin)</li>
                </ul>
                Some places at the US/Canada border take US cash, however relying on this and simply bringing US dollars
                is not a good idea.

                Almost every shop/business takes credit or debit cards, and ATMs are widely available, so you won't need
                to bring huge quantities of cash. ATMs often impose a withdrawal fee of $2-5 CAD.
