                Toronto is as cosmopolitan as they come. To newcomers, Toronto may seem like just another big city.
                Downtown is dotted with skyscrapers, the city's streets are bustling with people on the go and the
                public transportation system is top-notch. But lift up the hood of Canada's biggest city and you'll find
                there's more to the eye than an amazing skyline. <br><br>Toronto is considered one of the most culturally
                diverse cities in the world, with more than half the population born outside of the city.

                Toronto houses
                200 ethnic groups that speak upward of 140 different languages, making this Ontario destination a world
                all its own. With Greektown, Little Italy, Koreatown and Chinatown all within city limits, travelers may
                feel as if they've seen more than a couple of countries after a visit to Toronto.
                <br><br>
                The city is also home to one of the tallest freestanding towers in the world, the CN Tower, and the
                world's largest underground shopping mall, PATH. But aside from visiting its biggest attractions,
                Toronto should be experienced like any other big city: sipping a cocktail in a corner restaurant,
                browsing multicultural shops on quirky neighborhood blocks and hopping on and off the subway for a night
                on the town.
